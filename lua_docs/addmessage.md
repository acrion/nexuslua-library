addmessage {#addmessage}
==========

Within nexuslua, the [addmessage](addmessage.md) function plays a pivotal role in defining the communication interface for an agent.
It facilitates the registration of new messages that the agent can receive and process, either from other nexuslua scripts or C++ applications.

Essentially, when you register a message using `addmessage`, you're setting up an entry pointâ€”a way for other parts of your system to make asynchronous function calls to this agent.

The function accepts the message name to be registered as first parameter.
Optionally, a second parameter may be provided, see below section **Advanced Usage with Metadata**.

# Basic Usage

A prime example is the `IsPrime` function. It determines if an input number is prime and sends back a corresponding result:

```lua
function IsPrime(parameters)
    local number = tonumber(parameters.number)
    q = math.sqrt(number)
    found = true
    for k=3,q,2 do
        d = number/k
        di = math.floor(d)
        if d == di then
            found = false
            break
        end
    end

    return {isPrime=found}  -- This result is sent back to the agent designated in the reply_to table of the sent message.
end

addmessage("IsPrime")
```

The function expects a single integer number as a parameter, and the message can be dispatched using the `send` function:

```lua
send("numbers", "IsPrime", {number=127, reply_to={agent="main", message="CountPrime"}})
```

Here, besides specifying the number for the prime check, the example dictates where the `{isPrime=found}` result should be relayed.

# Advanced Usage with Metadata

For applications like the [acrion image tools](https://github.com/acrion/image-tools) that employ a GUI, messages often require additional metadata, such as a display name, description, or icon.
Moreover, even though nexuslua natively recognizes Lua types, these messages can further describe the expected parameters, including their type, for better interface clarity:

```lua
addmessage("CallSubtractLeftRightLua", {
    displayname="left-right (Lua)",
    description="Subtract working image from reference using Lua (click twice to undo)",
    icon="",
    parameters={
        workingImage   = { type = "void*"},
        referenceImage = { type = "void*"},
        width          = { type = "long long"},
        height         = { type = "long long"},
        channels       = { type = "long long"},
        depth          = { type = "long long"}
}})
```

However, it's crucial to understand that this type information and metadata have no direct impact on the nexuslua's functioning.
They primarily serve the GUI to render and interpret the parameters appropriately.

# Key Insights

With `addmessage`, an agent outlines how it should respond to a specific message.
It's not merely a function for adding functionalities but a method for defining communication protocols between agents.
When an agent receives a message it has registered via `addmessage`, it knows precisely what action to undertake.
The addition of metadata, as demonstrated in the "acrion image" example, illustrates that messages can also serve to describe agents in a user interface, enhancing nexuslua's interoperability and user-friendliness.

When executing the command line interface of nexuslua, the script may call `addmessage`, because it is internally executed as an agent with name `"main"`.
